# GitHub-Tutorials
Hello,
My name is Gordon Wang and I am trying to navigate through this universe.
Through the method of trial and error, I hope that I could improve...
Despite this, I also understand the challenges. This will not be easy.
Having little to no experience with GitHub, I am indeed slightly at a loss...

This attempt in making changes in Tutorial 1, should mean that I am making changes in this branch...
Pulling requests is more like raising your hand and commeting at that particular branch right?
Best of Good Luck !
